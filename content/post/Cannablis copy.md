###### Canna Pop-Up
The best way to describe the Canna Pop-Up event is one-part social event, one-part
education, one-part foodie, one-part art exhibit, and ALL parts for anyone with an open
mind. Pop-up experiences last for only a brief period of time. They are transitory and as a
result, exciting and compelling.
The Canna Pop-Up experience will elevate your senses to a higher level. We bring people
together to learn about cannabis for health, wellness, self-care, and caregiving. Our pop-up
events will exhibit what tasteful, responsible adult use could look and feel like.
The cannabis industry has made remarkable strides and itâ€™s our desire to help shape the
cannabis landscape in the NJ/NY area and create buzz and excitement about medical and
adult-use. Until then, we have a very powerful supplement, Cannabidiol (CBD), a cannabis
extract legal in all 50 states and is proven to have calming and stress-relieving effects,
among other positive health benefits for a variety of medical and social conditions.
