Deep in the legislation that lawmakers say will fix the perceived mistakes in the medical marijuana law is a nugget of hope for patients who do not qualify for the program yet.

The leader of the Cannabis Regulatory Commission -- the new entity that would be created by the bill to control the medicinal program and the hypothetical legal market-- would decide which conditions qualify for cannabis. 

That power now rests with the state Health Commissioner, advised by a panel of medical experts. Until March, only one condition, post traumatic stress disorder, had been added to the narrow list included in the 2010 law.

Patients enroll first by working with a doctor who must recommend them to the program, then applying for a membership card through the health department.


Gov. Phil Murphy, who took office in January, added two forms of chronic pain, anxiety, Tourette's syndrome and migraines to the list in March. The enrollment has since risen 57 percent to 32,300 participants, according to health department data.

Murphy also granted Health Commissioner Shereef Elnahal unilateral authority to add conditions to the list.


Giving that decision-making responsibility to the commission's executive director cuts through the red tape that has bound up the process of expanding the list of conditions during the Christie years, Sen. Joseph Vitale, D-Middlesex, a prime sponsor of the bill.

It could also encourage more doctors to recommend patients to the program, Vitale said. There are just 775 doctors out of the 28,000 licensed in New Jersey who are registered with the program, with 234 joining since March, according to state data.

The amendments to the bill, obtained by NJ Advance Media say:

"The executive director may waive any requirement of (the existing medicinal marijuana law) if the executive director determines that granting the waiver is necessary...to provide access to patients who would not otherwise qualify for the medical use of cannabis to alleviate suffering from a diagnosed medical condition, and does not create a danger to the public health, safety, or welfare."
