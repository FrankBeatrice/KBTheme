###### CannaBliss by Kym B
CBD infused eye cream
Review by: Lacey Yannelli @lacey_project

Packaging
CannaBliss comes plain, simple and elegant as is. There is no fancy flashy box to discard. Kym tries to
keep waste to a minimum, as a very earth conscious person. Everything you need to know about the
product is clearly displayed on the product itself. Though the type is small, you can still clearly read
every ingredient on the list. Personally, I find the golden cannabis leaf logo to be first sign that what is
inside the jar is quality!

Ingredients
Every ingredient in this product was chosen not only for its high quality, but also for its natural and
beneficial properties. All ingredients are ethically and responsibly selected. There are no unnecessary
mystery fillers with questionable origins. Though a few of the ingredients may sound a little intimidating
or scary, this product is chemical free. It&#39;s probably the most natural product in my arsenal, aside from
my jar of raw organic coconut oil! But seriously, nothing I buy at Ulta is anything like this.

Color, smell, texture
The cream itself is white as snow. It is essentially odorless. I think it smells a little like paste, which brings
me back to childhood and usually brings a smile to my face, but I&#39;m a bit of a nostalgia addict these
